### <a name="intersection_1"></a>intersection_1
>Quentin: This project started out following the SUMO tutorial [quick start](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Tutorials/quick_start) however, I ended up making my own map instead and learning how to use *netedit* that way.

This is the interesection of Rockridge Rd & US Hwy 98 N created usign *netedit*. It is a simple example of how edges, lanes and junctions fit together and also a good reference for learning to use *netedit*.
